class GaussianLinearDiscriminant:
    """
    A Gaussian linear discriminant classifier that fits to a training dataset and makes predictions. 
    The model assumes that each class follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution for each feature with a common covariant matrix for all classes.

    Some mathematical simplifications are used to speed up computations. For example, the actual multivariate Gaussian distribution is never computed directly; instead, only the arguments of its exponentials are used. Additionally, when predicting the class label for a vector, we only consider the addends that vary across classes, ignoring constants that remain the same for all classes.
